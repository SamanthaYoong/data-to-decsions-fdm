## 💡 Approach

### 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Structured raw sales, category, and region tables using SQL.
- Removed outliers (e.g., refunds marked as sales), nulls, and duplicates.
- Normalized date values for trend analysis.

### 2. Data Modeling & KPIs Defined
- Created a star schema:
  - `Fact_Sales`, `Dim_Region`, `Dim_Category`, `Dim_Date`
- Defined key metrics:
  - Revenue per Region  
  - Profit Margin %  
  - Category Contribution  
  - YoY Growth Rate

### 3. BI Dashboard in Tableau
Built an interactive dashboard including:
- 📌 Regional performance heatmap  
- 📌 Category-wise margin trendlines  
- 📌 Dynamic filters for branch and time period  
- 📌 Executive summary with red-flag alerts  

### 4. Insights & Recommendations

| Insight | Actionable Recommendation |
|--------|----------------------------|
| West Malaysia region had 15% lower profit margin | Shift marketing spend to high-margin products |
| Fashion category showed strong revenue but high return rates | Launch customer review analysis to reduce return drivers |
| Branches with stagnant YoY growth | Test seasonal bundling strategies, especially for electronics |
